        <h1> Keycaps the King of Aesthetic</h1>

        <p> Now to the most fun descision in the customization of your keyboard: The keycaps!</p>

        <p> Choosing keycaps isn't mandatory or necessary (unless you are making a keyboard completely from scratch).
            In fact, you could skip this section entirely and just buy your keyboard.
            But choosing your keycaps can prove to be an endearing task that most people would enjoy!
        </p>

        <p>
            The choice in your keycaps can give you the unique chance to discover what aesthetic you like, or see what color schemes you typically enjoy, get employed in keyboard customization.
            Whatever the case may be, choosing your keycaps is a chance for you to reflect a piece of yourself into your keyboard and enhance your satisfaction with it!
        </p>

        <a class = "keylista"> Two Keycap Types: </a>
        <ul class="keylist" >
            <li class="keylist_item">ABS Keycaps: These are the cheapest and most common plastic used for keycaps. These are lower quality but feel smooth and are easily replaceable.</li>
            <li class="keylist_item">PBT Keycaps: These are more high-end keycaps and are less commonly found. However, they are more durable and have a textured feel to them. They are likely to last for a long time.</li>
        </ul>

        <img class = "homeimg" src = "ABSvsPBT.png">

        <p> The left, as you can see, is a PBT keycap, since it looks more smooth and has a more "highend" lettering. 
            And to the right, is the ABS keycap, which is more textured, has an engraved lettering like it came out of a mold, and generally looks more "cheap". 
            You can easily tell based on the texture, yet don't let the way these specific keycaps look determine your choice of ABS or PCB! 
        </p>

        <p> Typically both can be utilized for customization, it really does just come down to a matter of budget, preference, and durability.</p>
