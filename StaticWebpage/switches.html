        <p> Now for your continued introduction into the world of keyboards, there are two type of keyboards set ups you must familiarize yourself with: Hot-Swap and Soddering. </p>

        <p> 
            To summarize this, essentially Hot-Swap PCB keyboards, are keyboards whose electrical components can be removed and replaced easily, as shown to the right. 
            Soddering PCB keyboards on the other hand the components must go through a process called soddering to added or replaced within the keyboard, as shown to the left.
        </p>

        <div class = "row">
            <div class = "column">
                <img class = "side1" src = "solder.png">
            </div>
            <div class = "column">
                <img class = "side" src = "hotswap.png">
            </div>
        </div>

        <p> If you like to sodder your keyboard, currently this website will not host any informaiton regarding that, considering its a lot less of a beginner friendly process.
            So for now we will stick under the presumption that the keyboard most beginners would like to involve themselves in is a simple hot-swappable pcb keyboard.
        </p>

        <p> With this in mind, we can move on to the next important aspect of your keyboard: The sound.</p>

        <p> Surprisingly enough, the sound of your keyboard is something I believe many people should take into consideration when first looking into keyboard purchases. 
            This is because, when it comes to constantly typing or having to play a game, most people would likely prefer a keyboard that sounds pleasant to them.

            <iframe class = "yt1" src = "https://www.youtube.com/embed/bE9RM_jgkd8?si=v5oKN2oJpJJl0ziy" title = "Keyboard Sounds" frameborder = "0" allowfullscreen> </iframe>
        </div>

        <br>

        <p> 
            The video above is a simple demonstration of what kinds of sounds are available for keyboards. 
            For the most part, or actually nearly 99% of the time, keyboards tend to stick to one type of sound: Creamy, Clacky, Thoccy, or Poppy.
            Its rare for keyboards to have a variety of sound like above. 
            Regardless, based on this video, depending on what type of sound you like you would need to choose the specific switches to complement that sound!
        </p>

        <p>
            Now for those who don't know what switches are or what they do, rest assured they aren't too hard to learn about!
        </p>

        <p> 
            Essentially, switches are the mechanical mechanism underneath your keycaps that make that little "click" sound when you press down on the keys to type.
            They typically look like this:
        </p>

        <img class ="switchimg" src = "switches.png">

        <p> 
            While this may be a larger representation of how they look, typically you can easily fit multiple switches in the palm of your hand.
            And typically switches don't all look the same, they come in a variety of colors, forms and brands.
            Each with their own unique sound.
        </p>

        <p> However, for simplicity, usually people differentiate switch sounds by thier color. </p>

        <p> This video somewhat encapsulates that very meaning. Given that most switches typically follow this lineup. </p>

        <p> 
            As one can see, red and black switches are often the quietest, with blue and brown switches being some of the loudest. 
            The rest of the switches fall into a sort of area between the two on the scale of quiet to loud. 
        </p>

        <p> 
            Based on these switches you can easily tell what type of sound your keyboard is likely to make. Red, Black, and surprisingly Yellow, will result in more quiet creamy sounds.
            Whilst Blue and Brown may provide that extra clack that your keyboard will make.
        </p>

        <p>
            While the prior video may have given a general guide as to what color switches to look out for, theres also the matter of branding and switch lineup.
            Specific brands like Gaeteron provide switches that are generally cheap, yet they also provide more expensive switches in their "Milky Switch" lineup.
